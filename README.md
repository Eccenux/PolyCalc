PolyCalc
========

A JavaScript based CSS3 `calc()` polyfill.

Originally developed by [Chris Kay](https://github.com/CJKay/PolyCalc).
Reworked to use simple (and lite) CSS parser. So currently only jQuery is required.

Usage notes
-----------

You need both libraries with `SimpleCssParser` over `polycalc`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" data-PolyCalc="1" href="SimpleCssParser.js">
<link rel="stylesheet" data-PolyCalc="1" href="polycalc.js">
```

Note that you need to run PolyCalc both when page is loaded and resized. In some cases you might need to run PolyCalc also when elements resize (e.g. after loading additional content). You can use [jQuery resize plugin](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/) for that.

Also note that `resize` event does not fire when scrollbars appear. Thankfully you can force scrollbars to always appear. Don't worry - they won't be visible on mobile browsers.
```css
html {
	overflow-y: scroll;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}
```

Usage examples
--------------

### jQuery ###

In JavaScript you must run PolyCalc when page is ready or changed. So minimal JS is:
```js
$(function() {
	polyCalc.run();
});
$(window).resize(function() {
	polyCalc.run();
});
```

### jQuery Mobile ###

In jQuery Mobile (up to 1.4) you should use something like:
```js
// calc() when page elements are visible (and actually have size)
$(document).bind("pageshow", function() {
	polyCalc.run();
});
// after window resize (including possibly orientation change)
$(window).resize(function() {
	polyCalc.run();
});
```

### Example page ###

CSS (`example.css`):
```css
.inline-controls div {
	float: left;
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
.inline-controls .text {
	width: calc(100% - 9em);
	width: -webkit-calc(100% - 9em);
}
.inline-controls .short-btn {
	width:3em;
}
.inline-controls .long-btn
{
	width:6em;
}
```

HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" data-PolyCalc="1" href="example.css">

<!-- 
	...
-->

<div class="inline-controls">
	<div class="text">
		<input type="text" value="this will vary">
	</div>
	<div class="short-btn">
		<input type="button" value="OK">
	</div>
	<div class="long-btn">
		<input type="button" value="Cancel">
	</div>
</div>
```

Note that by default PolyCalc searches only for `width` and `height` properties. See PolyCalc source on information how to add other props to the list.
